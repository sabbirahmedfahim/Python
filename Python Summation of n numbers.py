#one
#kinda tricky codes
#one lesson is important for this code is that
#if i do not follow identation then it will print the last sum
'''
sum = 0

for i in range(1,5):
    sum = sum + i
    #print(sum)
print(sum)
'''


#two
#summation of 1 to 100
#why only last sum was printed?
#because print function violates identation. so it will print the last sum

'''sum = 0

for i in range(1,101):
    sum = sum + i
    #print(sum)
print(f"sum is equal to {sum}")'''
